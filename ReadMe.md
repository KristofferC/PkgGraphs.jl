# PkgGraph.jl &nbsp; [![][docbadge]][docs]

Small tool to visualize the dependency graph of a Julia package.

### Example

```julia
julia> using PkgGraph

julia> PkgGraph.open(:Unitful)
```
This will open the browser to [this url][dotlink], which renders the following image:

<!-- Generated with `PkgGraph.create("Unitful", "docs/img/")` -->
<!-- If updating this, update the link below too (`PkgGraph.Internals.url`) -->
<img src="docs/img/Unitful-deps.svg"
     width=680
     alt="Dependency graph of Unitful, rendered with Graphviz dot">

<br>
<details>
  
  The given package (here: [Unitful][unitful]) must be installed in the currently active project for this to work.

  Note that `PkgGraph` does not have to be installed in the same project however:\
  you can switch projects _after_ `PkgGraph` has been imported (using `pkg> activate â€¦`).

  Even easier is to install `PkgGraph` in your base environment (see [Global Install](#global-install)),
  so you don't have to switch projects at all.

### Local rendering

If you are offline and have [Graphviz `dot`](https://graphviz.org) installed on your PATH, you can use something like
```julia
julia> PkgGraph.create(:Unitful, ".", fmt=:svg)
```
This will call `dot` to create an SVG image in the current directory (`"."`), and will open it with your default image viewer.

If only the package-name is provided, a `tempdir()` and `fmt = :png` are used.


### Customization

The code tries to be modular. So if you want something a bit different than what the
above interface offers, you might be able to compose it from various internal
functions: see the Reference section in the <sub>[![][docbadge]][docs]</sub>.

## Installation

`PkgGraph` is available in the Julia General registry and can be installed with
```
pkg> add PkgGraph
```
This gives you `v0.1`, which is [kinda broken](https://github.com/tfiers/PkgGraph.jl/releases/tag/v0.1).
While waiting for `v0.2` to be released, you can install
a more up-to-date revision by specifying a URL directly
(see [Unreleased Changes](#unreleased-changes--) below).


### Global Install

You might want to install `PkgGraph` in your base environment (e.g. `v1.8`).\
You can then use it in any project, without having to install it in that project
or having to always switch projects.

<details>

You can activate your base environment using `] activate` (i.e. activate 'nothing'),
and then `add PkgGraph` there.

Another way to obtain a global install is to run â€“ from within _any_ environment:
```
julia> using PkgGraph
```
If the package is not found, Julia will offer to install it.\
Type '`o`' to choose to install it in your base environment.

### Versions  &nbsp; <sub>[![][latestimg]][latest]</sub>

See [`Changelog.md`](Changelog.md) for a list of package versions, and the changes introduced in each.

[latest]:    https://github.com/tfiers/PkgGraph.jl/releases/latest

### Unreleased Changes &nbsp; <sub>[![][commitsimg]][latest]</sub>

CI status for the latest commit on `main`
(aka _dev_ and _unstable_):

[![][testsimg]][tests] [![][docbuildimg]][docbuild]

You can install `PkgGraph` at this latest commit using
```
pkg> add https://github.com/tfiers/PkgGraph.jl
```
If you, wisely, do not want a moving `main` revision in your `Manifest.toml`,
you can install at a fixed revision (commit) instead.
Preferably at a [commit that passed tests][testhist].
For example:
```
pkg> add https://github.com/tfiers/PkgGraph.jl#fe17ba2
```

<!-- 
On the "Commits since [latest release]" button.

Currently the user has to click through on the release page
(on the gh-generated link "xx commits to main since this release").

We could add a `latest` tag (or branch?).
It can be automated: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/latest-tag

But moving a tag seems annoying, see https://pakstech.com/blog/move-git-tag/,
"Pulling after a tag has been edited" (you need to delete the local tag).

So, we rely on this click-through solution,
with the (undocumented?) `/releases/latest` url.

How does shields.io do this btw? â†’ Via an API call
(https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/7a38cfe/services/github/github-commits-since.service.js#L138)

## Development

### Roadmap

No progress guaranteed, _"Software provided 'as is'"_, etc.\
Ideas for improvement are currently managed with GitHub Issues.\
See: [Issues <sub>with low-priority ones filtered out</sub>][1]

### Contributions

Well-considered PRs, Issues, and Discussions are welcome.

Everyone is expected to adhere to the standards for constructive communication
described in [this Code of Conduct][CoC].

[CoC]: https://github.com/comob-project/snn-sound-localization/blob/17279f6/Code-of-Conduct.md

### Guide

Check out the code for development using
```
pkg> dev PkgGraph
```
See the readmes [in `test/`](test/ReadMe.md) and [in `docs/`](docs/ReadMe.md) for how to locally run the tests
and build the documentation.

**Releasing a new version**

1. Roll-over the [changelog](Changelog.md): rename the existing 'Unreleased'
   section to the new version. Add a new, empty Unreleased section.
   <!-- Could be automated prolly; add a step in Register.yml -->
2. Click the _Run workflow_ button [here][regCI], and bump the relevant version
   component. This will 1) create a commit that updates the version in `Project.toml`,
   and 2) create a comment on that commit that opens a PR in the General registry.
