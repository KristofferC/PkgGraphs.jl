<!-- No 'dev' docs badge please. Also is 'latest commit' or sth not better. And 'Stable' rather just the last release version!!
God. 
And a "build status" button? blegh.
Hm no ok, it's fine, it's useful: did tests of last commit succeed (and doc build).
But then don't call it Build youknow.
ehwell, fine.
maybe "CI"
or "Test & build docs | last commit".
or just fuckin nothing (although hm no, a shortcut is useful).

in any case, i had this nicely in prev repo's.
A nice documentation badge with a book somewhere.
And sth about last commit test success or the like as well.
