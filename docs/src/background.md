## Graph layout

'[Mermaid diagrams]' are something more newfangled than dot.
They use the [Dagre.js] library for graph layout, which is based on dot (see its [wiki], and [codebase]).

I find that dot's layout algorithm does a bit better than Mermaid / dagre's (even though Mermaid has prettier styling).
