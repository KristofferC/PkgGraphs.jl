Open the browser to an image of `pkgname`'s dependency graph.\\

Create a URL at which the dependency graph of `pkgname` is rendered as an image, using an

## How it works
The dependency graph of `pkgname` is created locally, and converted to a string in the
Graphviz DOT format (see [`deps_as_DOT`](@ref)). This string is URL-encoded, and appended to
a partly-complete URL, which is by default the first entry in the `PkgGraph.rendering_urls`
list. To use a different rendering website, use [`set_rendering_url`](@ref).
